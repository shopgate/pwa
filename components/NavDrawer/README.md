NavDrawer
---

The `NavDrawer` is designed to be the app's main navigation.
All items are defined inside the component or will be received via the shop configuration.

## Getting Started

```jsx
import NavDrawe from 'Components/NavDrawer';

<NavDrawer />
```

## Props

Since the `NavDrawer` is a connected component there are right now no public props that need to be set when adding the component.
